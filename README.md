## Overview

This project authentically replicates the desktop experience of the Cursor AI editor website. The implementation relies entirely on vanilla HTML and CSS, eschewing frameworks to demonstrate fundamental command of layout, typography, and visual hierarchy.

## Technical Details

- **Core**: Semantic HTML5 markup
- **Styling**: Modern CSS variables, Flexbox, and CSS Grid
- **Font**: Inter (via Google Fonts)
- **Design System**: Custom implementation mirroring the original site's token system

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main entry point containing the landing page structure
- `styles.css` - Global styles, variables, and component definitions
- `assets/` - Static resources and imagery

## Getting Started

Since this is a static site, no build process is required.

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser

## Notes

The current implementation is desktop-first, prioritizing the precise spacing and visual balance of the original design.
